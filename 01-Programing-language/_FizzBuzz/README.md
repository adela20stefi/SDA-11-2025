# Fizz Buzz Problem

## Problem Description
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to `n`. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Input
- An integer `n` representing the upper limit of the sequence (inclusive).

## Output
- For each number from 1 to `n`:
    - Print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3 and not by 5.
    - Print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 and not by 3.
    - Print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
    - Otherwise, print the number itself.
