## Problem: Number of 1 Bits

### Input
- An unsigned integer `n`.

### Output
- An integer representing the number of `1` bits in the binary representation of `n`.

### Details
- The input will be a non-negative integer.
- The output should be the count of bits set to `1` in the binary form of the input number.
- Example:  
    - Input: `11`  
    - Output: `3`  
    - Explanation: Binary representation of `11` is `1011`, which has three `1` bits.
